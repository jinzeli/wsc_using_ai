This is the project folder containing the source code for the Service Composition Prototype System. The system allows users to create and maintain knowledge domains in the AI planning language PDDL and generate plans according to their specific planning goals.

There are two planning systems stored in the directories /MBP and /sgplan under /public/system. The default planner is SGPlan5 that can be invoked in "domains" controller by the action "plan". It is only executable under Linux systems (tested on Ubuntu 10). To bring the system up and running on a MAC machine, it is recommended to change the planning system to MIPS-XXL that can be downloaded in http://sjabbar.com/mips-xxl-planner.
